Leave Management System Setup
============================

1. Place this folder in your XAMPP 'htdocs' directory.
2. Import 'leave_types.sql' and 'schema.sql' into your phpMyAdmin database (e.g., 'leave_management').
3. Update database connection details in the PHP files (to be created).
4. Access the system via http://localhost/leave_management_system/login.html

Pages:
- login.html: Login page
- register.html: Register page
- employee_dashboard.php: Employee dashboard (apply for leave)
- admin_dashboard.php: Admin dashboard (view/approve leaves)

You will need to implement the PHP backend for login, registration, leave application, and admin approval.
